# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI-Python-
This project involves creating a game of Tic-Tac-Toe where you can play against AI opponents of varying difficulty levels. The AI opponents include "easy," "medium," and "hard" modes. The "hard" mode was implemented using minimax algorithm. The game allows you to choose player types for both X and O, including human and AI players. 

- The game supports interactive player inputs and outputs using the terminal.
- Choose your preferred difficulty level for the AI opponent: "easy," "medium," or "hard."
- Play against another human player or an AI opponent, or let two AI opponents play against each other.
- The AI opponents use different strategies to make moves, with "hard" mode implementing a minimax algorithm for optimal play.
